This is an overview of how hardware works.

We use RespberryPi 3B for our main controller of the third box, and breadboard for LED display.
The RespberryPi will output the singal by GPIO to control the LED. The sensor connected by 4.7k Ohms resistor to a 3.3V and a GPIO.
Also we use GPIO to ciontrol the power switch and push button.
