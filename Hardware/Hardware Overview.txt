This is an overview of how the hardware works. The third box design is split into three parts: The box design, the breadboard design and the appropriate setup for RaspberryPi.
Please see the assembly instruction and drawings for how they fit together. A top-level parts list shows all parts needed for the third box design.

1. Box design:
We use a xx * xx paperboard box for our third box.
Firstly, for put xxx inside and outside of the box to and pass the dropping test.
Secondly, for fix the breadboard and RespberryPi, using sticky back.
Thirdly, cut the appropriate size of hole for power switch, push button, power supply cable, Ethernet cable, LED dsiplay
Fourthly, for power swithch and push button, gluing to the.
Finally, for easy modifiy and repair, use Velcro very easy to open and close.

2. The breadboard Design:
Breadboard is design for LED display.
The RespberryPi will output the singal by GPIO to control the LED. The sensor connected by 4.7k Ohms resistor to a 3.3V and a GPIO.
Also we use GPIO to ciontrol the power switch and push button.
See the Schematics of breadboard for more information.

3. Setup of RaspberryPi:
We use RespberryPi 3B for our main controller of the third box, 
Firstly, connect the Ethernet cable to the laptop used for user interface.
Connect the power supply calbe to 120V and 60 Hz power supply.
Connect the HDMI cable to a screen.(with keyboard and mouse if needed)
Connect GPIO output to breadboard. (See the assembly instruction for more details)
we use GPIO output GPIO 21,20,26,19,13,6,5 for LED display and  and GPIO inpit 23 for push button and GPOI 24 for power switch.
